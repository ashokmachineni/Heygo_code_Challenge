1)
OUTPUT:
console.log("2");
console.log("1");

reason:
first log is in timeout so second one called first.



2)
OUTPUT:
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

REASON:
first time it will print 0 when function called with parameter 0 then,
it will print 1 because it's called in if condition, while condition is not false it call with previousValue + 1.

3)
OUTPUT:
nothing

REASON:
function never called so output will be nothing.
4)
OUTPUT:
3

REASON:
"function foo(a)" is returning "function(b)",
so const "bar" value would be "function(b)" ,
but it called with parameter value "1";
so "a == 1" and "b == 2" it will return "a (1) + b (2 ) = c (3)};

5) you can used like this.

function double (a ,done) {
setTimeout(function() {
done(a * 2)
}, 100);
}

function done(parameter) {
console.log(parameter);
}

double(1, done);
